## Classroom

- Each classroom will have three roles:
    1. Admin  (Faculty who created the classroom) 
    2. Monitor (Students / Other Faculty who can act as TA's or CR's) 
    3. Students
    
> **Monitors are Teaching Assistants / Class Representatives picked by the admin.**
> 

- A classroom will have :
    - Channel - The place where members of the classroom interact with each other through text messages.
    - Category - Used to organize Channels into sections that users can collapse and expand.
    
> **Channels have messaging permissions associated with their role in the classroom.**
> 
    
- Admin / Monitor can :
    1. Update content moderation settings of a classroom.
    2. Add / Remove Users from the classroom.
    3. Add / Remove / Update channels of a classroom.

> 
- By default, content moderation is enabled in classroom on the creation.
